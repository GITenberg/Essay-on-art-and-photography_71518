<p class="drop-cap">The idea that occurred to
me in drawing in epitome
a history of the amalgamation
of <em>Art</em> and <em>Science</em>, and
ultimately induced me to attempt so
hazardous a task, was to enable the
public to learn the true course to be
pursued in order to give fresh vigour
and impulse for the revival of <em>Fine Arts</em>,
and I have endeavoured to exemplify
in a striking manner, as far as my poor<span class="pagenum" id="Page_viii">viii</span>
abilities admit, the inestimable advantage
the one confers upon the other,
which renders the combination so essential
in advancing and developing a better,
truer, and nobler style of art—a style
that I feel assured will distinguish for
ever the present generation. With this
view, I have gathered materials from
every common report or otherwise, from
personal acquaintance with some of the
most distinguished artists of the day,
and it is with regret that I find how
immeasurably incompetent I am to do
justice to a subject so worthy of being
treated by greater talents and accomplishments<span class="pagenum" id="Page_ix">ix</span>
than are granted to me. In
sketching the various changes Photography
has undergone ere it reached the
supremacy it now enjoys, owing—principally
to the natural instability of events—and
in the rapid survey to which the
limits of the Essay constrain me, I have
been compelled to point out defects “<em>both
in the Art and the Science</em>,” without reserve,
but with all due respect to the
opinion of others; but while doing so, I
trust that I have rendered justice also.</p>

<p>As a professional artist, the reader
may be led to suppose I write with
bias—not so. I have most cautiously<span class="pagenum" id="Page_x">x</span>
avoided any sentiment that might be so
construed, and beg that judgment may
be suspended until these pages have
been perused, the perusal of which, I
sincerely trust, may have the desired
effect—not actually resulting in the revival
of Fine Arts—but as an auxiliary for
paving the way for others commanding
a greater range of knowledge, who may
thereby be induced to embark in the
cause I am humbly seeking to advocate.</p>

<p class="drop-cap w">When Photography was
first introduced, it met
with a severe struggle ere
gaining the esteem it now happily
enjoys. Artists of all grades unanimously
condemned it, looking upon it
only in the light of a vehicle that would
carry destruction to their own especial
pursuits, while on those who attempted
to practice and advance it fell anathemas
and ridicule. So great was professional<span class="pagenum" id="Page_14">14</span>
prejudice, and so blind in its
apprehension, that it dexterously and
successfully biased and enlisted the
opinion of the Press in its favour, which
echoed the assertions that, under the
most favourable circumstances, “Photography
could only be a caricature of
the subject it portrayed.” Thus was the
combination of Art and Science for a time
checked in its progress, and the artists,
now exulting in having temporarily attained
their purpose, watched jealously
the science of chemistry, and depreciated
as useless any further inquiry that seemed
to encourage or aid Photography.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_15">15</span></p>

<p>The great body of the public, as usual
in all such cases, remained neutral, but
fortunately, for the advancement of the
new art, there remained a few who were
more sanguine than their cotemporaries,
and generously bestowed their sympathy
on the “oppressed.” They saw in
Photography, a great science, then but
in its infancy, but which must ultimately
compete with the finer arts; its peculiar
adaptation in copying rendering it still
more valuable, not only to artists, in
furthering their own success, by securing
truthfulness and accuracy, but likewise
in all the various usages to which it has<span class="pagenum" id="Page_16">16</span>
since been so successfully applied. Too
numerous to attempt to specify here.</p>

<p>At the period we speak of, Photography
was entirely confined to that
class of illiterate men who only pursued
it to benefit by its novelty, and like everything
new, particularly when added to
cheapness, produced a great amount of
bad taste and unpardonable vulgarity. It
is, no doubt, an art which is peculiarly
liable to be perverted to base and immoral
uses, but now that better taste
prevails, no such fears need be entertained.
All classes of society have
been benefited by Photography; it<span class="pagenum" id="Page_17">17</span>
has been a generous friend to the
poor as well as to the rich, and all must
acknowledge its superior advantages
and merits. Not only has it been fostered
and liberally supported by the
munificence of kings, but also in the
more humble walks of life has it been
welcomed as a benefactor. Its patrons
of all grades have not only derived pleasure
from the novelty of its fascinations,
but inexpressible consolation from the
<i lang="fr">souvenirs</i> it affords of cherished places,
and the memory of those loved ones
who may be far away, or sleeping the
“sleep of death.”</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_18">18</span></p>

<p>It would indeed be deplorable if an
art so consecrated to all that is noble,
pure, generous and holy, were again
to be jeopardised by the association of
bad taste and worse usages. In England
we are fortunately protected from such
an evil; but in other countries, particularly
in France, it still exists to an
alarming extent, and until the authorities
there adopt the same measure of punishment
as with us, no one can walk the
streets without being subjected to some
gross outrage against propriety and
moral feeling. Photography, therefore,
has a double claim upon our affections—to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_19">19</span>
preserve it unscathed and unsullied,
when we find it diverted into new
channels that may endanger its purity
and legitimate usefulness. An art which
assists the memory and educates the
taste is entitled to encouragement, the
more particularly, when by its aid we
can recall in privacy the happy hours
suggested by the contemplation of the
sure-reflected lineaments of a doating
mother, an affectionate sister, a tender
loving wife, or a fond and innocent
child.</p>

<p>One great reason why Photography is
so frequently applied to unworthy purposes<span class="pagenum" id="Page_20">20</span>
is, owing to its cheapness, for,
where there <em>is</em> a supply of anything
novel, combined with cheapness, patrons
will present themselves. This is a public
weakness which is to be regretted, for
although competition may be consistent
with the “spirit of the age,” it is an unpardonable
error when cheapness is
resorted to as a means to success, in
place of trying to excel by artistic or
superior merits alone.</p>

<p>In no stage of Photography have we
been further advanced and initiated
into the grand applications of its science
than by the introduction of the “paper<span class="pagenum" id="Page_21">21</span>
process;” it presented to the mind of
the photographer a channel for experimentalising
and uniting art proper with
his own, for previously the word <em>Art</em>
was foreign to the ear of the professional
photographer; all that was deemed essential
in the pursuit was that you should
acquire a knowledge how to produce a
photograph free from all the optical and
chemical defects. Light was only studied
to secure the <em>image</em> with brilliancy on
the plate, of the subject or object about
to be copied. If it came out clear,
clean, and sharp, the <em>operator</em> was delighted
with his success—its artistic<span class="pagenum" id="Page_22">22</span>
merits were never consulted; no question
asked whether the face came
out with the rich, soft, rotundity of
nature; whether the light and shade had
given tone and gradation, to add harmony
to the picture; whether the line of
the head had been carried to prevent
awkwardness to the figure; whether the
eyes did not look askance to the <em>pose</em>
of the head; its artistic superiorities, in
fact, were never looked for, which explains
why, at that period, photographs
were taken, as a general rule, simply
head-bust, most commonly called <em>vignettes</em>,
or as the Americans would term<span class="pagenum" id="Page_23">23</span>
it, <em>ambrotype</em>. Such were the productions
of the “Glass Age.” But from the time
the “paper process” established itself,
Photography at once took its place
among the finer arts, and having gained
the victory, the artists that had disdainfully
resented its popularity, ventured to
advance into the new field of enterprise,
and not only were they delighted in procuring
such an auxiliary, but they
laboured in trying to improve the application
of its science to <em>Portraiture</em>.
Though <em>painting</em> renders the chemical
result subordinate, and likewise subservient
to the skill of the artist, when<span class="pagenum" id="Page_24">24</span>
removed from the <em>pressure frame</em> to the
<em>easel</em>, yet in no way does it depreciate
Photography as an art which is necessary
to assist in securing with unerring
accuracy of outline momentary indications
of character, expression of face,
and costume, consisting of numberless
and minute details; all of which are at
once portrayed on a tablet of glass reflected
through the Camera; and which,
if not satisfactory to the mind of the
<em>operator</em>, he may arrange according to
his own artistic taste, judgment and skill,
with a view of securing pictorial effect
and individual character.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_25">25</span></p>

<p>It would be utterly impossible to estimate
the advantages Photography has
conferred upon all mankind, or to anticipate
the still greater wonders it is yet
destined to achieve.</p>

<p>Having sketched the early struggles
which Photography had to surmount
to claim a high place for its followers,
we now proceed to examine its distinguishing
features. In scrutinizing the
works of even the greatest artists of our
day, we are sure to find some fault—some
error. Why is it that imperfection
should exist even in works of the
highest rank, grand in conception, beautiful<span class="pagenum" id="Page_26">26</span>
in execution, rich in modulation,
truthfulness of outline and form, and
harmonious in colouring? For the simple
reason, that true excellence can only
be found in composition pictures where
the creative mind of the artist has been
free to labour in accordance with its own
poetic fancy, and when such perfection
exists in portraiture without the aid
of Photography, it will indeed be an
exception!</p>

<p>When the practical eye of an artist
takes up a Work of Art, he at once
recognizes the <i lang="fr">forte</i> of the genius in some
one particularity. Say for instance one<span class="pagenum" id="Page_27">27</span>
artist may excel in the master-stroke of
execution, and by a few strokes of the
brush give much more artistic and life-like
effect than another would by hours
of close application and the minutest
finish—the difference between these two
artists being that the one was a true born
artist, and the other a lover of the art—simply
one who had acquired its mechanism
from untiring study and practice.
We will again find others who excel in
the amalgamation of colours, others
for composition, others for costumes and
drapery—others for the delicacy and
transparency of the flesh tones; and we<span class="pagenum" id="Page_28">28</span>
might still further attempt to specify
their various <i lang="fr">fortes</i> of particular excellence,
by dissecting the human forms
and classify them by their technical terms
in anatomy. For instance, I have known
artists who have excelled in the execution
of a face, and yet fail in the representation
of the hair—all their heads conveying
to the observer an idea that they
were wigged! In other productions we
are at once made sensible that the artist
has one ideal for a nose, and if the picture
represents innumerable figures, they
are all possessed of the same type of
nasal organ! In others again, we find the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_29">29</span>
artist manifest in some peculiarity in the
eye or in the mouth; but it is not any of
these artistic individualities we ask for
when we are desirous of possessing a
faithful likeness of some loved one, nor
do we care to find as we scan their well-remembered
features, the artist’s ideal of
a nose, an eye, a mouth, a chin, or some
other member, in place of its, perhaps,
more homely characteristic. In nature
we are daily witnessing how the various
types of features, at once the most classic
and homely—highest and lowest, come
to mingle so congruously in one face, but
such as nature has thought fit to endow<span class="pagenum" id="Page_30">30</span>
us, such do we want to be faithfully and
accurately delineated, and if such combination
of distinctive specialities of art
are required for portraiture, which is
rarely, if ever, found individually, then
how inestimable is the aid of Photography!
Many are under the impression
that its process exaggerates to such an
extent that the object or subject reproduced
is figuratively distorted, which
constituted the opprobium attached to
its productions. This is a mistake. If
the operator uses a first-class instrument,
and sufficiently large to secure the same
perfect definition at the extreme margin<span class="pagenum" id="Page_31">31</span>
of the plates as in the centre, and regulated
by the diaphragm with space sufficient
for the required length of focus, no
aberation or distortion will be visible.
But if a questionable lens is used, and
the aperture too small for the flatness of
“field” required, then the whole model
will be more or less distorted; its receding
lines obtruding as to become
perfectly blurred and indistinct; the
shadows black, without detail, and the
lights hard and flat. But let it be remembered
that this Essay is entirely
confined to the aspirants to Art in its
higher branches. Photography in the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_32">32</span>
hands of a lover of its art, initiated in
the theory and practical knowledge of
its science, would not waste valuable
time in the production of such enormities.
We have, therefore, only to deal
with its advantages in its higher order of
execution; or if we deviate a while from
our theory, it is but to confirm our arguments,
and give the reader an opportunity
to discriminate for himself between the
two. But to return to the fallacy of portraiture
being confined to the erroneous
pencil of the deceitful imagination of an
artist possessing one or more only of
those capabilities essential to the production<span class="pagenum" id="Page_33">33</span>
of the truthfulness of individuality.
How can it be expected that he
can pourtray, from a few short sittings
taken from nature, to be afterwards
finely finished from memory with that
unerring accuracy that the Photograph
identifies? I have never yet seen a
portrait painted from life that conveyed
the idea of life. As the eye rests upon
the canvas, the mind at once feels that
artificially life has been attempted to be
represented, even when the likeness has
been so striking as to draw from the
observers an exclamation of “how like,”
and in its artistic merits “how beautiful.”<span class="pagenum" id="Page_34">34</span>
But the absence of that individuality
which casts an air of naturalness in the
Photographic production is lost in the
creative picture, and the cold statue-like
aspect which is conventual in Art, in no
way associates the mind with a sentiment
of familiarity in the past or present, as
the case may be. Then how is it, it may
be asked, that an artist who has given to
the world works of surpassing excellence—standard
models for future ages—is
yet incapable of adapting himself
to pourtray the simplicity of real life
as it is? Why cannot the artist thus
enabled to invest the imaginary characters<span class="pagenum" id="Page_35">35</span>
of his works with all the sparkling
vivacity of life, identify the same in portraiture?
To solve this problem we must
glance and circumspectly dwell for a
time on the personal characteristics of
artists. Not that we would suppose, or
would wish to suggest that fac-similar
<em>traits</em> are hereditary to the born artist;
but as countries are remarkable for their
individual nationalities, so are the peculiarities
in the temperament of an artist.
We might without offence notify it by
calling it eccentricity, for it has been
said that genius and eccentricity are inseparable.
The active and creative mind<span class="pagenum" id="Page_36">36</span>
of an artist is ever busy arranging
subjects for his art. If not drawn from
Scriptural, historical, or poetical sources,
it is from some grand scene of nature
memory has conjured up as he treads,
the path of life, ruminating with all the
fancy of the imaginative poet buried in
those early dreams yet to be realised in
the various phases of life in some poetic
fashion, glowing resplendently, as personified
in the mock <i lang="fr">Tableau Vivants</i>
of his conception, at a future day to be
developed upon a piece of canvas cloth,
and embodied in all the beauty and
vigour of life; its characters standing out<span class="pagenum" id="Page_37">37</span>
in bold relief so prominent in their varied
and natural imitation, that you might
fancy they were in reality breathing the
very breath of life!</p>

<p>Thus left to conceive and portray by
the inspired hand of genius without the
fastidious or exacting interference of his
patrons, the artist will assuredly be successful,
perhaps beyond his most sanguine
expectations, but once interfere with him,
the spell is broken, and once compel
him to make alterations against his will,
not only will you find his touches niggardly,
but they are given without firmness,
force, or effect. The touches might<span class="pagenum" id="Page_38">38</span>
be given at random, for any advancement
of their creative merit; his ideas are, in
fact, crippled, and if that picture is ever
completed, the eye and mind will at once
intuitively feel that there is a want, and
that want will be inspiration.</p>

<p>The ideas of an artist are irreproachable
and impassable. Once confined,
his own conceptions swayed, his capabilities
are disabled; mind and hand must
be as free as the wind of heaven, unshackled
by prejudice or importunities.</p>

<p>Having thus solved the problem why
artists cannot adapt themselves to follow
nature in its identical peculiarities, the<span class="pagenum" id="Page_39">39</span>
same reasons likewise explain the necessity
why Art and Photography should be
combined, a consumation still more desirable
in the art of portraiture, where
the artist, perforce, is made obedient to
the truth of reality.</p>

<p>The portrait thus conveyed by Photography,
is not only an immense saving
of time, labour and trouble, both to artist
and sitter, by being enabled to secure
individuality, but the variety of talent
required for an artist to execute a
portrait from life, is thus adequately
balanced.</p>

<p><span class="pagenum" id="Page_40">40</span></p>

<p>In the “Operating” Department
another stamp of artistic merit is required—“Conception,”—the
eye being called upon in every way to arrange
such pictorial effect that its every production
may be in themselves studies.
Thus has the felicitious combination of
Science and Art become irrevocably
united—each depending upon the other
for success. The latter is, as I have
before remarked, distinguished for its
unerring accuracy of drawing in all its
individual properties and shading; the
former for imparting all the glowing
warmth of nature; and this inestimable<span class="pagenum" id="Page_41">41</span>
acquisition has likewise invoked a higher,
purer, and simpler standard for the
truthful representation of contemporaneous
life, by unavoidably adhering to
the reality of nature, surrounding, in
place of being personified, in some fantastic
guise or otherwise poetic myth.</p>

<p>Art, in the present age, stands conspicuous
for its great achievements in
<em>Truthfulness</em>, which has been guided
and assisted by the aid of the Camera.
Perspective, the great key to Art, was
fabulous before Photography was introduced;
and by its aid what perfection
has it not obtained, not only is distance<span class="pagenum" id="Page_42">42</span>
mathematically exact, but the round,
soft, accuracy of light and shade in
nature, is most beautifully defined!</p>

<p>Photography not only aids and assists
the Fine Arts, but gives invaluable aid
to Architecture, Astronomy, Geology,
Mineralogy, Science of Chemistry, Physiology,
Literature, and numberless
sciences, and likewise what the human
eye is incapable of discerning, the microscope
reveals and Photography delineates.
Thus are we supplied with
copies perfected by its aid, of every work
of art, ancient and modern, thus multiplied
and preserved for generations to<span class="pagenum" id="Page_43">43</span>
come. We will now glance, in conclusion,
upon the defects which have
tended to constitute that opprobrium
attached to the productions of photographic
portraits by the public in general.
The opinion that Photography exaggerates
to such an excess that, the lineaments
it has pourtrayed are quite distorted,
or that five or ten years have
suddenly been added to a “sitter’s” age,
and their youth apparently eclipsed by
the lines being, perhaps, too harshly
defined, and the shadows too strongly
marked, adding innumerable furrows,
reverential and admired in old age,<span class="pagenum" id="Page_44">44</span>
but despised in youth! This defect
is most easily obviated, and no one
who loves his profession will consent to
such over-printed copies going out into
the world, for it is by the after process
that this defect exists, and not in the
actual taking of the photograph, unless
the subject is very badly lighted, which
will occur when there is too much or too
little light. It is possible to print a
proof until all the details, even in the
high lights, are entirely obliterated, and
the likeness scarcely discernable. But
this is entirely the fault of the artist.
Care must be taken that each impression<span class="pagenum" id="Page_45">45</span>
is carefully watched, and printed
according to scale; this undoubtedly
requires the most exacting patience and
perseverance; but with untiring care
expended upon each impression not the
slightest trace of exaggeration will be
visible, every shade and detail will be
rich in the soft rotundity which nature
rejoices in.</p>

<p>These few short hints, and brief and
explanatory statements of General Art
Principles, may, we trust, be found enlightening
and useful to all supporters
of Fine Art, not forgetting that a small
grain of seed often becomes a goodly<span class="pagenum" id="Page_46">46</span>
tree; let us not trample its first tender
shoots beneath our feet, in contempt
at its feeble efforts to obtain expansion,
as it breaks from its mother bed of
soil to imbibe the freshness of the
dew-drops and the glorious sunbeam
of day. No!—let us by careful training
assist its maturity by removing from its
path any noxious weeds that spring up
spontaneously, and by the same method
of cultivation eradicate the evils that
threaten to sap its tender youth.</p>

<p>If this theory had been in practice
some hundred years ago, how much
further advanced might the world have<span class="pagenum" id="Page_47">47</span>
been, had not neglect and cold indifference
thrown its shadow on all scientific
pursuits? Then, let us not fall into the
folly of our ancestors by standing aloof,
each waiting for the other to take the
first step in advance, so biased by the
prejudice of the times that we unite
in the general cry, in place of going
forward and judging discriminately for
ourselves.</p>

<div>
1.F.1. Project Gutenberg volunteers and employees expend considerable
effort to identify, do copyright research on, transcribe and proofread
works not protected by U.S. copyright law in creating the Project
Gutenberg™ collection. Despite these efforts, Project Gutenberg™
electronic works, and the medium on which they may be stored, may
contain “Defects,” such as, but not limited to, incomplete, inaccurate
or corrupt data, transcription errors, a copyright or other
intellectual property infringement, a defective or damaged disk or
other medium, a computer virus, or computer codes that damage or
cannot be read by your equipment.
</div>

received the work on a physical medium, you must return the medium
with your written explanation. The person or entity that provided you
with the defective work may elect to provide a replacement copy in
lieu of a refund. If you received the work electronically, the person

opportunity to receive the work electronically in lieu of a refund. If
the second copy is also defective, you may demand a refund in writing
without further opportunities to fix the problem.

Section 2. Information about the Mission of Project Gutenberg™
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ is synonymous with the free distribution of
electronic works in formats readable by the widest variety of
computers including obsolete, old, middle-aged and new computers. It
exists because of the efforts of hundreds of volunteers and donations
from people in all walks of life.
</div>
<div>
Volunteers and financial support to provide volunteers with the
assistance they need are critical to reaching Project Gutenberg™’s
goals and ensuring that the Project Gutenberg™ collection will
remain freely available for generations to come. In 2001, the Project
Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation was created to provide a secure
and permanent future for Project Gutenberg™ and future
generations. To learn more about the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation and how your efforts and donations can help, see
Sections 3 and 4 and the Foundation information page at www.gutenberg.org.

Section 4. Information about Donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary Archive Foundation
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ depends upon and cannot survive without widespread
public support and donations to carry out its mission of
increasing the number of public domain and licensed works that can be
freely distributed in machine-readable form accessible by the widest
array of equipment including outdated equipment. Many small donations
($1 to $5,000) are particularly important to maintaining tax exempt
status with the IRS.
</div>
<div>
The Foundation is committed to complying with the laws regulating
charities and charitable donations in all 50 states of the United
States. Compliance requirements are not uniform and it takes a
considerable effort, much paperwork and many fees to meet and keep up
with these requirements. We do not solicit donations in locations
where we have not received written confirmation of compliance. To SEND
DONATIONS or determine the status of compliance for any particular state
visit <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org/donate/">www.gutenberg.org/donate</a>.
</div>
<div>
While we cannot and do not solicit contributions from states where we
have not met the solicitation requirements, we know of no prohibition
against accepting unsolicited donations from donors in such states who
approach us with offers to donate.
</div>
<div>
International donations are gratefully accepted, but we cannot make
any statements concerning tax treatment of donations received from
outside the United States. U.S. laws alone swamp our small staff.
</div>
<div>
Please check the Project Gutenberg web pages for current donation
methods and addresses. Donations are accepted in a number of other
ways including checks, online payments and credit card donations. To
donate, please visit: www.gutenberg.org/donate.

Section 5. General Information About Project Gutenberg™ electronic works
</div>
<div>
Professor Michael S. Hart was the originator of the Project
Gutenberg™ concept of a library of electronic works that could be
freely shared with anyone. For forty years, he produced and
distributed Project Gutenberg™ eBooks with only a loose network of
volunteer support.
</div>
<div>
Project Gutenberg™ eBooks are often created from several printed
editions, all of which are confirmed as not protected by copyright in
the U.S. unless a copyright notice is included. Thus, we do not
necessarily keep eBooks in compliance with any particular paper
edition.
</div>
<div>
Most people start at our website which has the main PG search
facility: <a href="https://www.gutenberg.org">www.gutenberg.org</a>.
</div>
<div>
This website includes information about Project Gutenberg™,
including how to make donations to the Project Gutenberg Literary
Archive Foundation, how to help produce our new eBooks, and how to
subscribe to our email newsletter to hear about new eBooks.
